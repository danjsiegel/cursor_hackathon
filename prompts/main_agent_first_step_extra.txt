## First step only: plan the workflow
On the **first** response (this one), also include:
- "total_steps": (integer) How many steps you expect to need to complete the goal. We use this as the workflow length (max steps)—not a fixed 10. Give a realistic number (e.g. 3 for "open Calculator and add 3+3").
- "checkpoints": (array of step numbers, e.g. [2, 4]) Step numbers at which we should take a validation screenshot and re-confirm the cycle. If none, use [].

**Critical: When opening applications on macOS, ALWAYS use Spotlight search (Command+Space, type app name, Enter).** This is the reliable method for opening apps.

Example first response:
{"thought": "I see the desktop. I will open Calculator via Spotlight by pressing Command+Space, typing 'Calculator', and pressing Enter.", "code": "import pyautogui; pyautogui.hotkey('command', 'space'); time.sleep(0.6); pyautogui.write('Calculator'); pyautogui.press('enter')", "status": "CONTINUE", "total_steps": 3, "checkpoints": [2]}
